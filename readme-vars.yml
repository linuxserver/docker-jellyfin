project_blurb: "[{{ project_name|capitalize }}]({{ project_url }}) is a Free Software Media System that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media. It is an alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple apps. Jellyfin is descended from Emby's 3.5.2 release and ported to the .NET Core framework to enable full cross-platform support. There are no strings attached, no premium licenses or features, and no hidden agendas: just a team who want to build something better and work together to achieve it."

  The [official documentation for ports](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/networking/index.html) has additional ports that can provide auto discovery.

  Service Discovery (`1900/udp`) - Since client auto-discover would break if this option were configurable, you cannot change this in the settings at this time. DLNA also uses this port and is required to be in the local subnet.

  Client Discovery (`7359/udp`) - Allows clients to discover Jellyfin on the local network. A broadcast message to this port with "Who is Jellyfin Server?" will get a JSON response that includes the server address, ID, and name.

  ```
    -p 7359:7359/udp \
    -p 1900:1900/udp \
  ```

  The [official documentation for environmentals](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/configuration.html) has additional environmentals that can provide additional configurability such as migrating to the native Jellyfin image.

  ### Hardware Acceleration Enhancements

  This section lists the enhancements we have made for hardware acceleration in this image specifically.

  ### Intel

  To enable the OpenCL based DV, HDR10 and HLG tone-mapping, please refer to the OpenCL-Intel mod from here:

  https://mods.linuxserver.io/?mod=jellyfin


  #### OpenMAX (Raspberry Pi)

  Hardware acceleration users for Raspberry Pi MMAL/OpenMAX will need to mount their `/dev/vcsm` and `/dev/vchiq` video devices inside of the container and their system OpenMax libs by passing the following options when running or creating the container:

  ```
  --device=/dev/vcsm:/dev/vcsm
  --device=/dev/vchiq:/dev/vchiq
  -v /opt/vc/lib:/opt/vc/lib
  ```

  #### V4L2 (Raspberry Pi)

  Hardware acceleration users for Raspberry Pi V4L2 will need to mount their `/dev/video1X` devices inside of the container by passing the following options when running or creating the container:

  ```
  --device=/dev/video10:/dev/video10
  --device=/dev/video11:/dev/video11
  --device=/dev/video12:/dev/video12
  ```
