project_blurb: "[{{ project_name|capitalize }}]({{ project_url }}) is a Free Software Media System that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media. It is an alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple apps. Jellyfin is descended from Emby's 3.5.2 release and ported to the .NET Core framework to enable full cross-platform support. There are no strings attached, no premium licenses or features, and no hidden agendas: just a team who want to build something better and work together to achieve it."

  Webui can be found at `http://<your-ip>:8096`

  More information can be found in their official documentation [here](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/quick-start.html) .

  ## Hardware Acceleration
  
  ### Intel
  
  Hardware acceleration users for Intel Quicksync will need to mount their /dev/dri video device inside of the container by passing the following command when running or creating the container:

  ```--device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri```

  We will automatically ensure the abc user inside of the container has the proper permissions to access this device.
  
  ### Nvidia
  
  Hardware acceleration users for Nvidia will need to install the container runtime provided by Nvidia on their host, instructions can be found here:

  https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker

  We automatically add the necessary environment variable that will utilise all the features available on a GPU on the host. Once nvidia-docker is installed on your host you will need to re/create the docker container with the nvidia container runtime `--runtime=nvidia` and add an environment variable `-e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all` (can also be set to a specific gpu's UUID, this can be discovered by running `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=gpu_name,gpu_uuid --format=csv` ). NVIDIA automatically mounts the GPU and drivers from your host into the jellyfin docker container.
  
  ### MMAL/OpenMAX (Raspberry Pi)
  
  Hardware acceleration users for Raspberry Pi MMAL/OpenMAX will need to mount their `/dev/vc-mem` and `/dev/vchiq` video devices inside of the container and their system OpenMax libs by passing the following options when running or creating the container:

  ```
  --device=/dev/vc-mem:/dev/vc-mem
  --device=/dev/vchiq:/dev/vchiq
  -v /opt/vc/lib:/opt/vc/lib
  ```

  ### V4L2 (Raspberry Pi)
  
  Hardware acceleration users for Raspberry Pi V4L2 will need to mount their `/dev/video1X` devices inside of the container by passing the following options when running or creating the container:
  ```
  --device=/dev/video10:/dev/video10
  --device=/dev/video11:/dev/video11
  --device=/dev/video12:/dev/video12
  ```
