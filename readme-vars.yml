project_blurb: "[{{ project_name|capitalize }}]({{ project_url }}) is a Free Software Media System that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media. It is an alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple apps. Jellyfin is descended from Emby's 3.5.2 release and ported to the .NET Core framework to enable full cross-platform support. There are no strings attached, no premium licenses or features, and no hidden agendas: just a team who want to build something better and work together to achieve it."

  The [official documentation for ports](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/networking/index.html) has additional ports that can provide auto discovery.

  Service Discovery (`1900/udp`) - Since client auto-discover would break if this option were configurable, you cannot change this in the settings at this time. DLNA also uses this port and is required to be in the local subnet.

  Client Discovery (`7359/udp`) - Allows clients to discover Jellyfin on the local network. A broadcast message to this port with "Who is Jellyfin Server?" will get a JSON response that includes the server address, ID, and name.

  ```
    -p 7359:7359/udp \
    -p 1900:1900/udp \
  ```

  The [official documentation for environmentals](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/configuration.html) has additional environmentals that can provide additional configurability such as migrating to the native Jellyfin image.

  ## Hardware Acceleration
  
  ### Intel
  
  Hardware acceleration users for Intel Quicksync will need to mount their /dev/dri video device inside of the container by passing the following command when running or creating the container:

  `--device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri`

  We will automatically ensure the abc user inside of the container has the proper permissions to access this device.
  
  ### Nvidia
  
  Hardware acceleration users for Nvidia will need to install the container runtime provided by Nvidia on their host, instructions can be found here:

  https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker

  We automatically add the necessary environment variable that will utilise all the features available on a GPU on the host. Once nvidia-docker is installed on your host you will need to re/create the docker container with the nvidia container runtime `--runtime=nvidia` and add an environment variable `-e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all` (can also be set to a specific gpu's UUID, this can be discovered by running `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=gpu_name,gpu_uuid --format=csv` ). NVIDIA automatically mounts the GPU and drivers from your host into the jellyfin docker container.
  
  ### OpenMAX (Raspberry Pi)
  
  Hardware acceleration users for Raspberry Pi MMAL/OpenMAX will need to mount their `/dev/vcsm` and `/dev/vchiq` video devices inside of the container and their system OpenMax libs by passing the following options when running or creating the container:

  ```
  --device=/dev/vcsm:/dev/vcsm
  --device=/dev/vchiq:/dev/vchiq
  -v /opt/vc/lib:/opt/vc/lib
  ```

  ### V4L2 (Raspberry Pi)
  
  Hardware acceleration users for Raspberry Pi V4L2 will need to mount their `/dev/video1X` devices inside of the container by passing the following options when running or creating the container:

  ```
  --device=/dev/video10:/dev/video10
  --device=/dev/video11:/dev/video11
  --device=/dev/video12:/dev/video12
  ```
