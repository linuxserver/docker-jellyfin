[Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin) is a Free Software Media System that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media. It is an alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple apps. Jellyfin is descended from Emby's 3.5.2 release and ported to the .NET Core framework to enable full cross-platform support. There are no strings attached, no premium licenses or features, and no hidden agendas: just a team who want to build something better and work together to achieve it.

## Supported Architectures

We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker [here](https://distribution.github.io/distribution/spec/manifest-v2-2/#manifest-list) and our announcement [here](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2019/02/21/the-lsio-pipeline-project/).

Simply pulling `lscr.io/linuxserver/jellyfin:nightly` should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags.

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Available | Tag |
| :----: | :----: | ---- |
| x86-64 | ✅ | amd64-\<version tag\> |
| arm64 | ✅ | arm64v8-\<version tag\> |
| armhf | ❌ | |

## Version Tags

This image provides various versions that are available via tags. Please read the descriptions carefully and exercise caution when using unstable or development tags.

| Tag | Available | Description |
| :----: | :----: |--- |
| latest | ✅ | Stable Jellyfin releases |
| nightly | ✅ | Nightly Jellyfin releases |

## Application Setup

Webui can be found at `http://<your-ip>:8096`

More information can be found on the official documentation [here](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/quick-start.html).

### Hardware Acceleration Enhancements

This section lists the enhancements we have made for hardware acceleration in this image specifically.

### Intel

To enable the OpenCL based DV, HDR10 and HLG tone-mapping, please refer to the OpenCL-Intel mod from here:

https://mods.linuxserver.io/?mod=jellyfin


#### OpenMAX (Raspberry Pi)

Hardware acceleration users for Raspberry Pi MMAL/OpenMAX will need to mount their `/dev/vcsm` and `/dev/vchiq` video devices inside of the container and their system OpenMax libs by passing the following options when running or creating the container:

```
--device=/dev/vcsm:/dev/vcsm
--device=/dev/vchiq:/dev/vchiq
-v /opt/vc/lib:/opt/vc/lib
```

#### V4L2 (Raspberry Pi)

Hardware acceleration users for Raspberry Pi V4L2 will need to mount their `/dev/video1X` devices inside of the container by passing the following options when running or creating the container:

```
--device=/dev/video10:/dev/video10
--device=/dev/video11:/dev/video11
--device=/dev/video12:/dev/video12
```

### Hardware Acceleration

Many desktop applications need access to a GPU to function properly and even some Desktop Environments have compositor effects that will not function without a GPU. However this is not a hard requirement and all base images will function without a video device mounted into the container.

#### Intel/ATI/AMD

To leverage hardware acceleration you will need to mount /dev/dri video device inside of the container.

```text
--device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri
```

We will automatically ensure the abc user inside of the container has the proper permissions to access this device.

#### Nvidia

Hardware acceleration users for Nvidia will need to install the container runtime provided by Nvidia on their host, instructions can be found here:
https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit

We automatically add the necessary environment variable that will utilise all the features available on a GPU on the host. Once nvidia-container-toolkit is installed on your host you will need to re/create the docker container with the nvidia container runtime `--runtime=nvidia` and add an environment variable `-e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all` (can also be set to a specific gpu's UUID, this can be discovered by running `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=gpu_name,gpu_uuid --format=csv` ). NVIDIA automatically mounts the GPU and drivers from your host into the container.

#### Arm Devices

Best effort is made to install tools to allow mounting in /dev/dri on Arm devices. In most cases if /dev/dri exists on the host it should just work. If running a Raspberry Pi 4 be sure to enable `dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d` in your usercfg.txt.

## Usage

To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli.

### docker-compose (recommended, [click here for more info](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/docker-compose))

```yaml
---
services:
  jellyfin:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/jellyfin:nightly
    container_name: jellyfin
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
      - JELLYFIN_PublishedServerUrl=192.168.0.5 #optional
    volumes:
      - /path/to/jellyfin/library:/config
      - /path/to/tvseries:/data/tvshows
      - /path/to/movies:/data/movies
    ports:
      - 8096:8096
      - 8920:8920 #optional
      - 7359:7359/udp #optional
      - 1900:1900/udp #optional
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### docker cli ([click here for more info](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/))

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=jellyfin \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=Etc/UTC \
  -e JELLYFIN_PublishedServerUrl=192.168.0.5 `#optional` \
  -p 8096:8096 \
  -p 8920:8920 `#optional` \
  -p 7359:7359/udp `#optional` \
  -p 1900:1900/udp `#optional` \
  -v /path/to/jellyfin/library:/config \
  -v /path/to/tvseries:/data/tvshows \
  -v /path/to/movies:/data/movies \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  lscr.io/linuxserver/jellyfin:nightly
```

## Parameters

Containers are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-p 8096` | Http webUI. |
| `-p 8920` | Optional - Https webUI (you need to set up your own certificate). |
| `-p 7359/udp` | Optional - Allows clients to discover Jellyfin on the local network. |
| `-p 1900/udp` | Optional - Service discovery used by DNLA and clients. |
| `-e PUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-e TZ=Etc/UTC` | specify a timezone to use, see this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List). |
| `-e JELLYFIN_PublishedServerUrl=192.168.0.5` | Set the autodiscovery response domain or IP address. |
| `-v /config` | Jellyfin data storage location. *This can grow very large, 50gb+ is likely for a large collection.* |
| `-v /data/tvshows` | Media goes here. Add as many as needed e.g. `/data/movies`, `/data/tv`, etc. |
| `-v /data/movies` | Media goes here. Add as many as needed e.g. `/data/movies`, `/data/tv`, etc. |

## Environment variables from files (Docker secrets)

You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend `FILE__`.

As an example:

```bash
-e FILE__MYVAR=/run/secrets/mysecretvariable
```

Will set the environment variable `MYVAR` based on the contents of the `/run/secrets/mysecretvariable` file.

## Umask for running applications

For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional `-e UMASK=022` setting.
Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) before asking for support.

## Optional Parameters

The [official documentation for ports](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/networking/index.html) has additional ports that can provide auto discovery.

Service Discovery (`1900/udp`) - Since client auto-discover would break if this option were configurable, you cannot change this in the settings at this time. DLNA also uses this port and is required to be in the local subnet.

Client Discovery (`7359/udp`) - Allows clients to discover Jellyfin on the local network. A broadcast message to this port with "Who is Jellyfin Server?" will get a JSON response that includes the server address, ID, and name.

```
  -p 7359:7359/udp \
  -p 1900:1900/udp \
```

The [official documentation for environmentals](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/configuration.html) has additional environmentals that can provide additional configurability such as migrating to the native Jellyfin image.

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags), permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id your_user` as below:

```bash
id your_user
```

Example output:

```text
uid=1000(your_user) gid=1000(your_user) groups=1000(your_user)
```

    ```

## Updating Info

Most of our images are static, versioned, and require an image update and container recreation to update the app inside. With some exceptions (noted in the relevant readme.md), we do not recommend or support updating apps inside the container. Please consult the [Application Setup](#application-setup) section above to see if it is recommended for the image.

Below are the instructions for updating containers:

### Via Docker Compose

* Update images:
    * All images:

        ```bash
        docker-compose pull
        ```

    * Single image:

        ```bash
        docker-compose pull jellyfin
        ```

* Update containers:
    * All containers:

        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d
        ```

    * Single container:

        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d jellyfin
        ```

* You can also remove the old dangling images:

    ```bash
    docker image prune
    ```

### Via Docker Run

* Update the image:

    ```bash
    docker pull lscr.io/linuxserver/jellyfin:nightly
    ```

* Stop the running container:

    ```bash
    docker stop jellyfin
    ```

* Delete the container:

    ```bash
    docker rm jellyfin
    ```

* Recreate a new container with the same docker run parameters as instructed above (if mapped correctly to a host folder, your `/config` folder and settings will be preserved)
* You can also remove the old dangling images:

    ```bash
    docker image prune
    ```

### Image Update Notifications - Diun (Docker Image Update Notifier)

>[!TIP]
>We recommend [Diun](https://crazymax.dev/diun/) for update notifications. Other tools that automatically update containers unattended are not recommended or supported.

## Building locally

If you want to make local modifications to these images for development purposes or just to customize the logic:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-jellyfin.git
cd docker-jellyfin
docker build \
  --no-cache \
  --pull \
  -t lscr.io/linuxserver/jellyfin:nightly .
```

The ARM variants can be built on x86_64 hardware using `multiarch/qemu-user-static`

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset
```

Once registered you can define the dockerfile to use with `-f Dockerfile.aarch64`.
